**About CPFQueryCollectionViewController**
I use Parse.com as my go-to BaaS and am building apps that require populating UICollectionViews with server data. Parse has a built in convention for populating UITableViews with server data but they do not have one for UICollectionViews. Lots of people have requested that Parse add a PFQueryTableViewController equivalent for UICollectionView but they have not so Hampus Nilsson created it by himself and I improved it with 2 pull requests.
